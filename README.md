# Fake-News-Detection

This repository focuses on detecting fake news using Machine Learning Ensemble Methods, specifically leveraging the LIWC (Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count) dictionary for feature extraction. The project aims to develop a robust model that can accurately distinguish between genuine and fabricated news articles.
